* A Java program that implements an interface called "Operations" to calculate the area and perimeter of various geometric shapes (Square, Rectangle, Circle and Triangle).
* The program should allow the user to choose the method by which he/she wants to perform the calculation.
* The solution provided should include the use of interface operations with the areaCalculate() and perimeterCalculate() methods to calculate the area and perimeter of various shapes.
* The Square, Rectangle, Circle and Triangle classes implement the "Operations" interface and provide the corresponding implementations for calculating area and perimeter.
* The Runner class contains the main() method, which allows the user to select the desired shape and perform area and perimeter calculations.
